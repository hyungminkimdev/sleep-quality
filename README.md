## üìã Project Overview

This project develops a predictive model using Bayesian Networks to analyze the complex relationships between multiple factors that influence sleep quality. By leveraging machine learning techniques and probabilistic modeling, the system provides insights into how various lifestyle choices, demographic factors, and physiological markers affect sleep quality ratings.

### Key Features
- **Multi-dataset Integration**: Combines health statistics with social media usage patterns to create a comprehensive sleep quality model
- **Melatonin Level Inference**: Novel approach to predict melatonin levels based on available lifestyle data
- **Probabilistic Modeling**: Uses Bayesian Networks to capture complex dependencies between variables
- **Evidence-based Predictions**: Incorporates academic research to establish meaningful relationships between factors

## üéØ Objectives

1. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop a Bayesian Network capable of predicting sleep quality ratings based on input conditions
2. **Factor Analysis**: Identify and quantify the most influential factors affecting sleep quality
3. **Relationship Discovery**: Uncover complex interdependencies between lifestyle, demographic, and physiological variables
4. **Practical Application**: Provide a tool for individuals to understand how their habits might affect their sleep quality
